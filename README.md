Network Packet Analyser
The Network Packet Analyzer is a simple packet sniffing tool developed in Python. It captures and analyzes network packets to provide insights into the traffic flowing through a network interface. The tool displays key information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and payload data. This project is intended for educational purposes, focusing on understanding network communication and packet analysis.

Features
Captures live network packets on a specified network interface.
Displays detailed information about each packet, including:
Source and destination IP addresses.
Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
Source and destination ports (for TCP/UDP).
Payload data.
Provides real-time monitoring of network traffic.
Ensures ethical use with a focus on learning and research purposes only.
Tools and Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the tool.
Scapy: A powerful Python library for network packet manipulation and analysis.
